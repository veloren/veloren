## Welcome To Veloren!

Veloren is a multiplayer voxel RPG written in Rust. Veloren takes inspiration from games such as Cube World, Minecraft and Dwarf Fortress. The game is currently under heavy development, but is playable.

## Development

Currently the communication of contributors happens mainly on our [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/kjwJwjK). You can join it to keep up with the development, talk to us or contribute something yourself. Anyone who shows genuine effort to help is welcome in our team. You don't have to know how to program to contribute!

## Get Veloren

Currently we provide 64-bit builds for Linux and Windows which can be downloaded on the official website: 
[https://www.veloren.net](https://veloren.net/welcome)

*Note: Mac and 32-bit systems are supported but you need to [compile the game for them yourself](https://book.veloren.net/compile/index.html).*

Due to rapid developement stable versions become outdated fast and might be **incompatible with the public server**.

If you want to compile Veloren yourself, take a look at the [How to Compile Guide](https://book.veloren.net/compile/index.html) in the book.
