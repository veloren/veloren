## Welcome to Veloren!

Veloren is a multiplayer voxel RPG written in Rust. It is inspired by games such as Cube World, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft. The game is in active development and enjoys a flourishing player community.

## Development

Currently, most communication among contributors takes place on our [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/veloren-community-449602562165833758). Similarly, we provide a [Matrix server](https://matrix.to/#/#veloren-space:fachschaften.org) as a more privacy-friendly alternative. You can join it to keep up with the game development, talk with the community or even contribute something yourself. Anyone who shows genuine effort to help is welcome to our team. You do not need to know how to code to contribute to the game!

Translators are welcome to contribute on our Weblate instance.

## Get Veloren

We provide builds for Windows, macOS and Linux. The game can be downloaded on the official website:

[https://veloren.net/download/](https://veloren.net/download/)

Due to rapid game development, stable versions become outdated fast and might be **incompatible with the public server**.

It is recommended to use [Airshipper](https://book.veloren.net/players/airshipper.html), our official launcher, to keep your game up-to-date easily.

If you prefer to compile the game yourself, follow the instructions in our [book](https://book.veloren.net/contributors/introduction.html).

## FAQ

### **Q:** How is this game licensed?

**A:** **It is free to play, modify and distribute. Forever.** Since it is a community project, we decided to license it under the **[GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html)**, which means it will always stay free and open source.

### **Q:** What platforms are supported?

**A:** Veloren can run on Windows, macOS and Linux on a great range of CPU architectures. However, the x86_64 architecture is the main focus in development. Official builds for the ARM64 architecture are also provided for macOS and Linux. It is likely possible to compile the game on other platforms as well.

### **Q:** Do you accept donations?

**A:** You can support the project financially on our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/veloren) page.
