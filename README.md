## Welcome To Veloren!

Veloren is a multiplayer voxel RPG written in Rust. Veloren takes inspiration from games such as Cube World, Minecraft, and Dwarf Fortress. The game is currently under heavy development but is playable.

## Development

Currently, the communication of contributors happens mainly on our [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/kjwJwjK). You can join it to keep up with the development, talk to us or contribute something yourself. Anyone who shows a genuine effort to help is welcome in our team. You don't have to know how to program to contribute!

Due to rapid development stable versions become outdated fast and might be **incompatible with the public server**.

If you want to compile Veloren yourself, follow the instructions in our [Book](https://book.veloren.net/contributors/introduction.html).

## F.A.Q.

### **Q:** How is this game licensed?

**A:** **It's free to play, modify and distribute. Forever.** Since it is a community project, we decided to license it under the **GNU GPL 3.0** license which means it will always stay free and open source.

### **Q:** What platforms are supported?

**A:** Veloren can run on Windows, Linux and Mac OS on all architectures (although x86_64 is our main focus). It's probably possible to compile Veloren on/for BSD, Fuchsia and others as well.
