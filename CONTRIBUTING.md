## Guidelines

### Do not commit tainted content to the repository

If you commit anything that was not created by yourself, double check that the license for that content permits to be distributed under our license.

Content generated by large language models or similar technology, such as Copilot, ChatGPT, or Llama, is presumed to be tainted content, and must not be committed.

The same goes for content generated by generative AI models for textures, voxel models, models, sfx, and music.
