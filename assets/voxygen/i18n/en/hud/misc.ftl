    To begin your journey you could start looking through this village and gather some supplies.

    You are welcome to take whatever you need on your journey!

    Look at the bottom right of the screen to find various things like your bag, the crafting menu and the map.

    The crafting stations allow you to create armor, weapons, food and much more!
